Dan's AP Computer Science Principles Things [Edhesive]

##Welcome
This is the stuff I have written for the AP Computer Science Principles Class for 2018 - 2019.  This is **NOT** intended to be the answers to the lesson/exercizes/whatever, but a place for me to easily store this stuff, as I use two different computers (Chromebook w/ Crouton while at school, and my desktop at home).
